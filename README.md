## Description

[Watch the Demo Video](#) <!-- Replace with your video link -->

I developed a command-line pet adoption center manager that allows shelter staff to easily create, view, and manage a list of animals available for adoption. This tool uses object-oriented programming principles, command-line prompts, HTML generation, and testing to ensure reliability and usability.

Users can add new animals, view current listings, and generate an adoption webpage complete with animal profiles and contact links.

## User Story

AS AN animal shelter manager  
I WANT to track animals available for adoption with their details  
SO THAT I can easily manage shelter records and share pet profiles with potential adopters

## Features

- Object-Oriented Class Structure:
  - `Animal` base class with common properties

- JSON data persistence using Node‚Äôs File System
- HTML generation to create a clean and informative adoption page
